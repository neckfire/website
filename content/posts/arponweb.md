Neckfire would have said that a normal system would be too usual, while a system accessible from his web browser would already be much better!
what does this mean ?
Neckfire would like to make Arpon OS a system accessible into a  network without anything installed from a browser. Maybe an update has to be done!
but knowing that for the moment the internet is not yet well established in the V1 of arpon, we risk to wait a little longer!
