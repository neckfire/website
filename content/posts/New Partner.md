After many problems of understanding, which cut the NFT into two teams, a bond is rebuilt between Neckfire (NFT) and Atomiseur69 (Ardor).
Today, an agreement has been created and the two teams are once again starting to create projects and play together.
Thanks again to TheFroger, Pauleems, Atomiseur69 and Alynésia.

"The Coterie Craft texture pack is developed by Coterie Craft Team, a one man man that helps run Coterie Craft Softworks, a small independent game studio located in California. As the sole proprietor of the company we make sure that skin packs and other content are being delivered to bedrock with ease.

Since 2010, I have worked hard on making sure that the pack remains to be updated and continue to do so. My company’s current goals are to take its time writing code for Optifine textures using Java to use optifine to its full potential, up scaling and bringing Minecraft the textures its deserve, as well as having fun."
