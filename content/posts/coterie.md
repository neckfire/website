COTERIE CRAFT
is not your traditional faithful pack, it's not default...

Instead, it has evolved into something eye-pleasing and iconic. Call it whatever you want: lush, soft, simple, smooth, HD, cartoony... it's whatever it needs to be to make Minecraft look like the game it ought to be.

"DEFAULT REVAMPED"
is just what I call it...

Coterie Craft intends to improve the appearance and fervor of Minecraft by giving it the textures it deserves, and that goal has been preserved thanks to the efforts of those who continue to use this pack.

This pack holds its original inspiration from ExtraNoise's QUANDARY PACK, which featured work from Bonemouse as well as myself, Cpt. Corn.

Inspiration:

For over 10 years Coterie Craft has used ExtraNoise's Quandary Texture Pack as a base. Since then Coterie Craft was given full rights to the author's work. Coterie Craft has evolved into a unique package of its own with the help of our team members, Ganlolde and karst who continued the pack around 2013-2015 when I was busy as well as myself for expanding the pack to future updates and an HD release.
