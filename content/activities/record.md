we will soon record some game we are dplaying, some progress on some project,
so you can see everything we do, IN VIDEO!

but we will not film everything, because it would take too much time, space and especially an extremely long video montage 
... unless you want the entire videos ...

And all of these videos are on [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3MNYmzbSBnZuVOMRUApABg)

You can still join the discord to be notified first!
