You know, we are making an Operating System, Arpon OS, but did you know that we want to make a game later? I don't think so, but you can help us! we are looking for :
- graphic designers (rather pixel style)
- programmers (who are able to create small 2D games on Unity)
- but you will say: 'yes but you will ask: "why do you ask for the services you offer?"'
- because we do it for fun, and making a game, although 2D, is quite complex, that's why we are looking for experienced people who could help us on a voluntary basis!
If the game is lucrative, ALL of the people who helped with the project will be paid according to their participation.
as usual, everything is done on our famous Discord!
