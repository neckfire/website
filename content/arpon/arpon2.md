ARPON OS OFFICIAL VERSION JUST RELEASED !
---
the first really usable version of arpon OS just release !
on the top :
- network connection
- Xserver
- apt to install program
- some optimisation
- changed the base of the OS :
before, neckfire wrote a code for arpon, he made the OS from scratch, 
now the OS is based on Debian.
what does it mean ?
- more stable
- more support
- some new features
but we lost a little of the lightweight what we earned before.

the bigest problem is that, we need an installation program. 
the OS is provided by a live ISO, but we don't know how to copy the system on another drive so, we need your help !

download it on : (the file is in uploading queue, please wait)
