# Arpon OS: A Lightweight and Fast Linux Distro for Development

Arpon OS is a Linux distribution that was first developed by Neckfire in 2018. The philosophy of this operating system is to be lightweight, fast, and highly customizable without using too many resources. The first usable version of Arpon OS was released in January 2021. This essay will discuss the features of Arpon OS, its history, and how to download and install it.

## Features of Arpon OS

Arpon OS is still in alpha, and it works only on shell without a network connection and tools to install programs easily. However, it contains Busybox, which allows users to enjoy lots of programs with the most performance possible. The development branch was created to build a system all made by the NFT, and to get some help and ideas, users can go to their Discord. The future goal of Arpon OS is to have its own interface, which will be closely linked to the command line. The i3 desktop will be used for maximum performance. Moreover, the development will soon be restarted to integrate IA, which will optimize the system in real-time.

## How to Download and Install Arpon OS

To download and install Arpon OS, users need a USB pendrive, an ISO image burning software like Etcher, and access to their boot menu. Alternatively, they can use an emulator like QEMU. In the first case, users need to connect their USB pendrive to their computer and download the ISO. They can then open their burning software (Etcher), choose the USB key, the ISO, and flash it. Afterward, they need to reboot their computer and open the boot menu, choose the USB pendrive, and start. In the second case, users need to download the ISO and the emulator. For example, they can use QEMU by opening CMD/terminal and typing the command: qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 [the path to the ISO].

## Conclusion

Arpon OS is a promising Linux distribution that is designed to be lightweight, fast, and highly customizable.
