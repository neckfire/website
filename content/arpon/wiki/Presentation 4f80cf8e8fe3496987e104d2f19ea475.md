# Arpon OS - A lightweight, clean, simple and optimized operating system for all.

Introduction

Arpon OS is an operating system designed to be optimized for all types of users, whether they are graphic designers, desktop users, gamers, or even as a server or database. Arpon OS is composed of two editions, a Debian-based edition with a graphical desktop and a user adaptive algorithm that selects useful packages to clean and optimize in real-time, as well as storage and performance, and a lightweight edition, also based on Debian, designed to be lighter and faster, which can be used as a server or on an old PC. These two editions are linked in development to obtain the same packages and software. A custom suite will be created to work with the operating system with a package of certain packages for designers, desktop users. The goal of Arpon is to be used on every computer, whether it is old or new, with all types of cards and ports.

1. His history

The Arpon project was born in July 2017. Initially based on the Mike OS operating system, but due to abandoned copyright, and after being remade with a Linux kernel. Development is long, with a lot of documentation, and in 2019, it really began, and the first version was launched in December 2020. Neckfire was alone in coding, but with this first version, some developers helped, and the project began to be better and faster. This project was to create our own operating system. Initially, it was called ERNEST, without any significance. We chose Arpon OS for Active Respectful Project Of New Operating System. It was just software similar to Lutris, but just for certain programs and at least an emulator.

Today, Arpon is fully functional, and it's a fully usable operating system. The first update was just a system capable of installing some programs with dpkg and performing simple tasks like a calculator or just a small notepad in the command line. The second version integrates apt and, with apt, every package we need, so the system was faster to develop at this stage. The third version integrates for the first time an X session with an i3 desktop. Some new patches were added to this version to optimize memory usage. Update 3.5 adds the Cinnamon desktop and a GDM3 as default.

1. His composition

First version on i3, it has evolved to LXQt and in the 3.5 update Cinnamon. It also uses GDM3. But later it will use its own desktop. Today, Arpon OS uses 700 MB of RAM for the graphical edition and only 200 MB for the lite edition. Some software packages will be built to be added based on the user profile, graphics pack, gaming pack, and some things like that. The desktop selector will be replaced by a type of session, and each session is ready to be used and optimized for its use. Based on a patched Xanmod kernel, optimized for low memory usage and CPU multicore usage. The installer used is the Systemback integrated software, but it will be replaced by its own. The biggest problem with Systemback is to update the whole system without erasing actual user data and package. Wine is preinstalled inside Arpon, and it is totally linked with the system to ensure easy compatibility with Windows applications. Session type will be managed by a self-made software in the taskbar to switch easily between sessions. All missing firmware will be found and added during development. After every session change, the system should be cleaned if the user wants. This cleaning is managed by Bleachbit. The default task manager is Stacer, doubled with htop on the console.

1. Our project for the future

After Arpon gets better, we want to add some unique features inside the system, like a big forum to resolve some problems powered by AI, Arpon developers will look at this forum to resolve in real-time these problems.

Conclusion

Arpon OS is an operating system designed to be optimized for all types of users, whether they are graphic designers, desktop users, gamers, or even as a server or database. With the Debian and Lite editions, all users will find an operating system suitable for their needs, with constant updates to improve their performance. Finally, the future project is to add unique features to the system so that users can enjoy the latest technologies and improve their user experiences.
