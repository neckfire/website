The first version of Arpon OS has been released! extremely simple, but already with a marked philosophy! The goal of this new linux distribution developed by neckfire is to remain extremely efficient while having the same advantages as the bigger ones. with a first version of a size of 30MB, the goal is to add more and more function over time while avoiding keeping things useless and optimizing the functions already present as much as possible.

arpon OS contains busybox to be able to enjoy lots of programs with the most performance possible. later, arpon OS will have its own interface, and will want to be closely linked to the command line. indeed, I would like to use the i3 desktop for maximum performance.

HISTORY
Development started in 2018 by neckfire, the first usable version released in january 2021.

The philosophy of arpon OS is to "be lightweight, fast and to get some posibilities like bigest linux distros."

"arpon OS need to be extremely customisable without using some unusely resources."

arpon OS contains busybox to be able to enjoy lots of programs with the most performance possible. later, arpon OS will have its own interface, and will want to be closely linked to the command line. indeed, I would like to use the i3 desktop for maximum performance.

to start, you must have:

- a USB key

- an iso img burning software (like etcher)

- have access to your boot menu

or else use an emulator, like QEMU

install / use
In the first case :

-----------------------------

- connect your usb key to your computer

- download the iso » https://download1489.mediafire.com/0iomq1dtdvag/ab1xghv9gyt96jt/arponos.iso

- open your burning software (etcher) choose the usb key, the iso and flash

- reboot your computer and open the boot menu, choose the usb key and start!

-----------------------------

In the second case :

-----------------------------

- download the iso and your emulator » download

In this example, I'll use qemu:

- open CMD / terminal and type the command:

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 [the path to the iso]

- start!
