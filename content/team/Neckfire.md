Neckfire created the NFT in 2017 with Thefroger, Sharkfire609, and Alynesia. But Sharkfire could not be very present, so the team was on hold for a while, but Neckfire always kept this idea in mind ...
with Alber, he continued to create small programs in batch then in bash on computers of his high school. Then he had an idea: before that he discovered Linux, and he decided to create his own system.
Today he did it, although very limited, his system works, it's ARPON OS.
today, the NeckFire Team is back, with more and more partners, more ambition and more knowledge, they are here, and intend to progress!

Neckfire's moto is: "never fear the fall"
