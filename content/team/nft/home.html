									<h2><a href="#">WHO WE<br />
									ARE</a></h2>
									<p>The Neckfire team is comprised of individuals who are passionate about computing and who are dedicated to sharing their knowledge with others. They believe that everyone should have access to the world of computing, regardless of their level of expertise, and they are committed to creating an environment that is friendly, supportive, and conducive to learning.</p>
<p>One of the core beliefs of the Neckfire team is that open source and proprietary technologies can coexist and even complement each other. They believe that by bringing together large companies and small businesses, as well as employees and students, they can create an atmosphere of cooperation and innovation that will benefit everyone involved.</p>
<p>To achieve their goals, the Neckfire team has developed a new type of enterprise structure that is organized into groups, with one head group managing all the others. Each of these groups focuses on a specific domain, and they serve as a workspace for both employees and students.</p>
<p>In addition to their enterprise structure, the Neckfire team is also focused on turning their enterprise into a school where they can train new employees and students. They want to share their knowledge and research with others, and they are committed to breaking down the walls between businesses to create a more open and collaborative environment.</p>
<p>Currently, the Neckfire team is focused on two primary objectives: building their enterprise and continuing with ARPON OS, a project that they have been working on. They are also developing a new game, an FPS puzzle game, where players can use a building wand to help them solve puzzles.</p>
<p>Overall, the Neckfire team is an exciting and innovative enterprise that is committed to advancing computing knowledge and skills in a collaborative and friendly environment. With their dedication and passion for computing, they are sure to achieve great things in the future.</p>
