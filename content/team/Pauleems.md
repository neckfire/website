Pauleems, who joined the NFT in June 2020 during the redesign of the NFT, is a person who looks serious but is actually quite fun and relaxed. He like Electro style music, he is an expert in Hardware, and often offers a good advice even if you have to be prepared to hear him yell as soon as something annoys him ... but it always makes you laugh, because despite that, we have never seen him in a bad mood, he recovers quickly and often gives a good dose of humor in the vocals!
he is a great World of Tanks and Minecraft player, also has a lot of FPS.
  With his RTX 2070 Super, he has one of the most powerful pcs in the team.
