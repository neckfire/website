Likes the music of Alan walker, an expert in Hardware, often offers a good idea even if you have to be prepared to hear him yell as soon as something annoys him ... but it always makes you laugh, because despite that, we do not never seen him in a bad mood, he recovers quickly and often gives a good dose of humor in the vocals!
