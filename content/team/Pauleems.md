Pauleems joined the NFT in June 2020 during the redesign of the NFT, person who looks serious but is actually quite fun and relaxed. Likes the music of Alan walker, an expert in Hardware, often offers a good idea even if you have to be prepared to hear him yell as soon as something annoys him ... but it always makes you laugh, because despite that, we do not never seen him in a bad mood, he recovers quickly and often gives a good dose of humor in the vocals!
great player of World of Tanks and Minecraft despite its current small config...
