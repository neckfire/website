Shyzera, or VIP + Shyzera for close friends ...
is a graphic designer and friends of Neckfire, she joined the team in late 2020 early 2021, designer and graphic designer who draws on styles like pokemon or just the different things she likes on the internet ...
she is also a minecraft player and you will understand pokemon, but very limited by that very limited config (which she dreams of changing ...) can not play the game too recent or just taking too many resources .. However, she doesn't hesitate to do what she likes. However, she starts in animation, where she should be very successful, because even if it takes a lot of time, if she invests herself, she could do great things ...
